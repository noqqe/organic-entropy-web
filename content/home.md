As you are reading this you hopefully connected using
[TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security). To
establish this connection you depend on random data which is provided by
your operating system. In order to generate randomness on a deterministic
machine (as computers are) you rely on **entropy**.

Did you ever think about where entropy comes from? The entropy that you
consume day by day is generated by poor devices under
really bad conditions. The bits are collected from non free-range living
sources. Domesticated unpleasantly kept sources. Can you really live with
that? We cannot. Entropy isn't just resource that you consume.

We think that should be different! We assembled a device that collects
entropy from real free living happy biologic sources. And this is how it
looks. Without antibiotics and pesticides.

Start using the organic entropy harvester that we created. See
[Guide](/guide) to build and use the device which
is even certified*. This is how example data looks like:

```
Temperature: 23.42 °C
Acceleration: X(-0.420) Y(-0.518) Z(-0.666)
Sound Intensity: 13
UV Light: 37 µW/cm²
```

In the past we thought a crazy combination of date and a `PID` is
enough...But a mixture of **Temperature**, **Acceleration**, **Noise** and
**Light** that you collect from your surroundings is really responsible.
This is how alternative hipsters use computers.

\**actually we are not. We created a dummy certification authority to have
something like this, which is quite common in this industry, as we've
learned.*
